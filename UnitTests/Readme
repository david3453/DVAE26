So a unit tetst for data preprocessing could be like, 
if my data preprocessing step removes rows which has N/A in a column. 
A unit test could be a function that takes as input a dataset and returns a dataset without N/A values. 
No matter what the input dataset is, even if the input dataset is a dataset that has never been seen before.


Exactly! A unit test for data preprocessing can be designed to ensure that your preprocessing function
 consistently removes rows with N/A values, regardless of the input dataset. This helps verify that yourÂ¨
  preprocessing logic is robust and behaves as expected.
